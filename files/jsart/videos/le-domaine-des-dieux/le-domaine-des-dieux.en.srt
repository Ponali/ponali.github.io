1
00:00:59,253 --> 00:01:01,253
Senators, I tell you...

2
00:01:01,253 --> 00:01:03,253
Those who have escaped
the claws of the lion,

3
00:01:03,253 --> 00:01:05,253
Will be poisoned by
the snake's venom.

4
00:01:06,086 --> 00:01:08,586
[blabbering]

5
00:01:08,586 --> 00:01:09,586
What?

6
00:01:12,073 --> 00:01:13,753
It's that... O Caesar...

7
00:01:13,753 --> 00:01:16,353
What exactly do you
mean by "snake venom"?

8
00:01:16,359 --> 00:01:18,159
Me, it's the lion's claws,
which I didn't understand.

9
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,000
Ah, me, I understood neither one,
nor the other.

10
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,100
lion's claws,

11
00:01:20,125 --> 00:01:22,191
The invincible power of Rome,

12
00:01:22,264 --> 00:01:25,164
As the snowflake
serfs closed in on--

13
00:01:25,176 --> 00:01:26,196
We had a snowflake?

14
00:01:26,196 --> 00:01:26,996
Hush!!!

15
00:01:27,079 --> 00:01:29,679
As the snowflake serfs closed

16
00:01:29,966 --> 00:01:31,973
closed on all continents, except

17
00:01:32,017 --> 00:01:33,457
Here in Armorica.

18
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:40,159
Where these irreducible Gauls continue to
laugh at the beasts of the imperial eagle!

19
00:01:41,034 --> 00:01:43,106
The imperial eagle, is
that a problem for anyone?

20
00:01:45,068 --> 00:01:49,292
Thus, these barbarians refuse
Rome, so Rome will go to them!

21
00:01:52,926 --> 00:01:54,393
Uhhh, that's it, is it now?

22
00:01:54,841 --> 00:01:56,521
Yes, it is now.

23
00:01:58,542 --> 00:02:02,454
The serpent's venom there it is.  Their
forests will leave room for our buildings.

24
00:02:03,177 --> 00:02:07,273
Surrounding their village, they
will have to adapt or disappear.

25
00:02:08,899 --> 00:02:10,019
[He is laughing.]

26
00:02:10,731 --> 00:02:12,883
I entrusted the construction
of our magnificent

27
00:02:12,883 --> 00:02:14,817
city to the young
architect Anglégus.

28
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:19,783
He has already designed many
buildings, many of which do not collapse.

29
00:02:22,357 --> 00:02:25,749
Well done, Anglegus.  I
love it, beautiful little model.

30
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:29,483
What are you going to call this city?

31
00:02:29,489 --> 00:02:31,169
At first, I thought--
- No, cancel that.

32
00:02:33,398 --> 00:02:35,406
Do you have a proposal,
Senator Prospectus?

33
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,640
We need a name that would indicate Rome...

34
00:02:39,897 --> 00:02:42,097
But that is not really Rome.

35
00:02:43,002 --> 00:02:44,002
Rume.

36
00:02:44,705 --> 00:02:45,705
Rume?

37
00:02:45,768 --> 00:02:48,992
Bah, it does not really invoke Rome?
- I'm afraid we're confusing it with-

38
00:02:49,119 --> 00:02:50,719
What do you think...

39
00:02:51,386 --> 00:02:53,066
From "Domain of the Gods"?

40
00:02:53,235 --> 00:02:54,915
The domain of the gods?

41
00:02:57,950 --> 00:02:59,630
I am not sure...

42
00:03:00,774 --> 00:03:02,974
Ah yes, still, it's not bad.

43
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,680
Hi!

44
00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:21,145
This one, Obelix, is for you.

45
00:05:21,307 --> 00:05:22,307
Of course, I saw him first.

46
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,320
Oh yeah?

47
00:05:25,361 --> 00:05:26,561
And there, he is afraid of me, not you!

48
00:05:26,922 --> 00:05:28,722
How do you know?  Did you speak it?

49
00:05:28,744 --> 00:05:31,045
It's always me who
sees the boars first!

50
00:05:31,045 --> 00:05:33,462
Or maybe I'll shoot you down
and get it without you knowing?

51
00:05:33,721 --> 00:05:35,855
OH YEAH HH!? MISTER
ASTERIX IS ESSENTIAL??

52
00:05:36,606 --> 00:05:37,312
Can you please stop??

53
00:05:37,312 --> 00:05:38,821
For the boar?  I'm
the fastest, you know.

54
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:40,352
I'm sure you mean
when you eat it.

55
00:05:40,449 --> 00:05:41,144
IT'S MINE!

56
00:05:41,469 --> 00:05:41,850
NO, MINE!

57
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:44,242
[they argue.]

58
00:05:46,942 --> 00:05:47,587
IT'S MINE!

59
00:05:47,587 --> 00:05:49,478
[He is laughing.]

60
00:06:00,442 --> 00:06:01,477
OBELIX!

61
00:06:02,154 --> 00:06:03,696
MY BOAR!

62
00:06:05,042 --> 00:06:06,855
GIVE IT TO ME!

63
00:06:07,952 --> 00:06:09,285
THIS IS NOT YOUR BOAR!

64
00:06:17,873 --> 00:06:19,280
[He is laughing.]

65
00:06:20,059 --> 00:06:20,546
o  h  !

66
00:06:29,797 --> 00:06:32,805
What did they put there,
by Toutatis?

67
00:07:00,941 --> 00:07:04,859
One, two, three, four...

68
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,810
125, 126, 127...

69
00:07:08,596 --> 00:07:10,086
...and one hundred and twenty-eight!

70
00:07:10,296 --> 00:07:11,926
This is the first tree to cut down!

71
00:07:20,312 --> 00:07:24,344
Don't touch the trees, Romans.
Idefix hates that.

72
00:07:24,607 --> 00:07:25,727
Come on Idefix!

73
00:07:29,251 --> 00:07:34,352
Get out here immediately!
This site is closed to the public!

74
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:54,548
I like it when unarmored Romans
fall.  It makes a funny noise.

75
00:08:07,036 --> 00:08:10,244
O Arbraracourcix our leader!

76
00:08:11,029 --> 00:08:13,547
He is in a meeting.
I can take a message?

77
00:08:16,158 --> 00:08:17,332
Come on, what do you want?

78
00:08:18,881 --> 00:08:19,977
A story of not fresh fish...

79
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:21,758
HOW IS IT NOT FRESH!?!?

80
00:08:22,427 --> 00:08:24,863
I WAS ANSWERING A QUESTION!!!

81
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:27,685
We ran into some Romans
in the forest, with strings.

82
00:08:29,917 --> 00:08:31,665
What kind of strings?

83
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:33,624
The kind where we trip over each other.

84
00:08:34,224 --> 00:08:36,683
This is a construction site
prohibited to the public.

85
00:08:39,687 --> 00:08:43,396
Well, it's just strings,
so it's not really bad!

86
00:08:45,494 --> 00:08:48,833
Go watch this site
anyway, just in case.

87
00:08:49,942 --> 00:08:51,057
HEY, WE WERE MAKING A REPORT!

88
00:08:51,329 --> 00:08:52,316
IT'S OVER, YOUR REPORT!

89
00:09:04,203 --> 00:09:05,729
It is intolerable
that mustachioed

90
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:07,211
barbarians come to
compromise Caesar's plans!

91
00:09:07,969 --> 00:09:11,971
I told you, the Gauls don't
like us walking in their forest!

92
00:09:11,971 --> 00:09:12,595
THEIR FOREST!?

93
00:09:12,622 --> 00:09:14,785
But, stop moving!!

94
00:09:17,145 --> 00:09:19,186
They believe they are at home, that's all.

95
00:09:21,774 --> 00:09:23,163
So we're going to Gauloiser their forest!

96
00:09:23,643 --> 00:09:25,219
It would have to be de-Gauloiser first.

97
00:09:25,717 --> 00:09:27,883
I remind you that Caesar is
counting on you. And-

98
00:09:28,237 --> 00:09:29,523
Ave centurion.

99
00:09:31,741 --> 00:09:34,176
The slaves complain of
an activity: They are bored.

100
00:09:34,328 --> 00:09:38,627
Operations are suspended
due to securing the site.

101
00:09:41,487 --> 00:09:43,887
I did not understand anything.
- It doesn't matter.

102
00:09:44,305 --> 00:09:47,760
Anglegus, I repeat to you, to avoid
the Gauls, you have to work at night!

103
00:09:47,871 --> 00:09:48,392
[He is laughing.]

104
00:09:48,551 --> 00:09:53,351
A night job!  It makes no sense.
- Just like your bandage.

105
00:10:02,427 --> 00:10:06,107
Centurion, forgive me, but my
collaborators and I are undecided.

106
00:10:06,107 --> 00:10:07,047
Should we pull?

107
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:10,471
How many times do I have to tell you,
you're waiting for my signal!

108
00:10:10,699 --> 00:10:12,403
What's your signal again?

109
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:15,408
For the 30th time is
when I raise my arm!

110
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:16,982
Absolutely.

111
00:10:21,129 --> 00:10:23,749
[the frog croaks]

112
00:10:25,673 --> 00:10:26,897
But what are we waiting for, by Jupiter?

113
00:10:27,054 --> 00:10:28,052
Hush!!!

114
00:10:28,052 --> 00:10:29,823
[ fearful whisper ] But what
are we waiting for, by Jupiter?

115
00:10:29,984 --> 00:10:32,072
I await the report of my scouts.

116
00:10:32,222 --> 00:10:36,802
Centurion! We think you're
messing around with the architect.

117
00:10:37,468 --> 00:10:39,148
GO BACK TO YOUR PLACE!!

118
00:10:51,599 --> 00:10:52,640
But what are you doing!?

119
00:10:52,917 --> 00:10:53,545
You raised your arm!

120
00:10:53,545 --> 00:10:54,959
But not at all!
- Oh yes!

121
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:57,007
So, clack, I gave the signal.

122
00:10:58,005 --> 00:10:59,746
Ave centurion.  The scouts in relation.

123
00:10:59,746 --> 00:11:01,026
But where were you?

124
00:11:01,026 --> 00:11:02,026
Well there!
- There?

125
00:11:02,354 --> 00:11:03,356
And you, what do you light up?

126
00:11:03,356 --> 00:11:05,196
We prefer not to stray too
far from here because of...

127
00:11:05,196 --> 00:11:05,612
[???]

128
00:11:05,964 --> 00:11:06,704
I hear nothing, because of what?

129
00:11:07,075 --> 00:11:08,115
GAULS!!

130
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:11,719
Gauls!?!?  Sound the retreat!

131
00:11:16,667 --> 00:11:17,787
Ave centurion.

132
00:11:19,511 --> 00:11:22,111
COME BACK IMMEDIATELY, YOU MORNINGS!

133
00:11:23,728 --> 00:11:24,728
Oh well...

134
00:11:37,709 --> 00:11:38,451
Woof woof!

135
00:11:39,536 --> 00:11:40,121
[Obelix laughs.]

136
00:11:40,121 --> 00:11:41,121
Idefix!?!?

137
00:11:43,868 --> 00:11:45,810
What's going on again?

138
00:11:48,359 --> 00:11:49,575
A blow from the Romans...

139
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,966
Here. Everything is in order.

140
00:12:12,506 --> 00:12:15,114
For those who have not followed, I repeat.

141
00:12:15,114 --> 00:12:15,633
YOU LISTEN!

142
00:12:15,992 --> 00:12:18,021
If you think we'll settle
for one tree a night,

143
00:12:18,021 --> 00:12:19,589
You poke your finger
in the eye to the Cubitus*

144
00:12:19,589 --> 00:12:21,244
Here!
- Shut up, Cubitus.

145
00:12:21,695 --> 00:12:24,759
Come on.  Where is the
tree we uprooted yesterday?

146
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:26,941
So, I don't have very,
very good news...

147
00:12:26,941 --> 00:12:28,252
It is no longer ripped off.

148
00:12:29,536 --> 00:12:30,845
The tree... it's replanted.

149
00:12:31,002 --> 00:12:33,161
...Figuratively?

150
00:12:33,161 --> 00:12:36,845
No, literally, look:

151
00:12:39,223 --> 00:12:40,174
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT

152
00:12:40,174 --> 00:12:40,957
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT (x2)

153
00:12:41,108 --> 00:12:41,907
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT (x3)

154
00:12:41,907 --> 00:12:45,070
Centurion! The little architect
starts making noise again!

155
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:47,336
Silence!  That's enough, we're going home.

156
00:12:47,336 --> 00:12:48,686
You can't fight such a miracle.

157
00:12:48,686 --> 00:12:50,790
No way!  We're going to uproot that tree!
- Again?

158
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:53,708
Yes again!  We're going to bring it back
to camp to make sure no one replants it!

159
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:58,324
We can do the uprooting of
the trees, but the transport...

160
00:12:58,848 --> 00:13:02,339
You're slaves, so you do what
you're told AND BUCK IT UP!!

161
00:13:03,107 --> 00:13:05,184
Centurion, you're the
one doing the tintouin now!

162
00:13:05,455 --> 00:13:07,332
YOU LOOP IT TOO!
AND YOU, YOU RIP!

163
00:13:09,893 --> 00:13:11,667
Luckily I didn't bring Idefix!

164
00:13:11,892 --> 00:13:13,679
O druid, what are we going to do?

165
00:13:13,832 --> 00:13:16,032
I have a funny little thing.

166
00:13:23,425 --> 00:13:24,590
A funny thing?

167
00:13:30,049 --> 00:13:33,890
Prodigious!  Do you realize,
Obelix, how fast they grow?

168
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:36,217
I don't know, how long
does it take to grow normally?

169
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,034
I have some not very funny news.

170
00:13:42,345 --> 00:13:43,427
Ah!!  Oh!!!

171
00:13:48,731 --> 00:13:50,984
It is true that at first sight,
it can be discouraging.

172
00:13:56,549 --> 00:13:59,489
We must also see the good
side, the motivation remains intact.

173
00:13:59,489 --> 00:14:00,676
And that is great.

174
00:14:08,459 --> 00:14:11,711
In any case, no one gave up, and we
should congratulate ourselves on that.

175
00:14:20,862 --> 00:14:22,303
Obélix, eat slowly!

176
00:14:22,303 --> 00:14:25,615
Well why do it?
Here, I have one glove left!

177
00:14:26,196 --> 00:14:27,623
NO, OBELIX, NO!

178
00:14:29,636 --> 00:14:33,747
OBELIX!  YOU WILL TAKE UP
THIS TREE FOR ME IMMEDIATELY!

179
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:35,937
Oh no.  I can't do that to Idefix.

180
00:14:39,467 --> 00:14:45,277
So if I understand correctly.  Not only
is the construction site not progressing...

181
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:48,917
And the Romans don't want to live there!

182
00:14:51,147 --> 00:14:54,194
Our citizens think about
the idea of ​​living in harmony.

183
00:14:54,194 --> 00:14:57,564
How about building the Domain
of the Gods just outside of Rome?

184
00:14:57,564 --> 00:14:59,246
People wanting to live
there won't have to go that far.

185
00:14:59,246 --> 00:15:01,269
FIND ME A GOOD SOLUTION
STRIP OF INCAPANCES

186
00:15:01,269 --> 00:15:03,339
OR YOU WILL ALL END AT
THE ARENAS WITH THE LIONS!

187
00:15:03,804 --> 00:15:07,475
This will entertain the citizens!
Without taking them far from home!

188
00:15:09,871 --> 00:15:11,178
The arenas...

189
00:15:12,226 --> 00:15:14,595
That's a great idea, Caesar.

190
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:27,245
Ah!  Minerva, I'm going to gut you!
- Hercules! Help! Hercules!

191
00:15:27,472 --> 00:15:33,908
Tadaaaa! It's me, Hercules!
You will pay for it, you mean villain!

192
00:15:34,155 --> 00:15:38,773
Apeljus... Is it obligatory,
the carnage?  Massacres?

193
00:15:39,051 --> 00:15:40,851
But leave him, he's having fun!

194
00:15:41,221 --> 00:15:44,114
But it's crazy!  Where is
he going to find all this?

195
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:59,039
Do we do a double or triple take?
- Double, double!

196
00:15:59,632 --> 00:16:04,302
And the cervical, how are you?
- Yes, except sudden movements.

197
00:16:05,281 --> 00:16:07,729
Ready for the crunchy kick?
- Ready!

198
00:16:11,623 --> 00:16:12,793
I never liked that shot.

199
00:16:13,657 --> 00:16:15,337
Alright, sorry dude.

200
00:16:17,168 --> 00:16:19,282
Don't try to do it three times!

201
00:16:19,744 --> 00:16:21,678
[introduction of RTL Matin (french radio)]

202
00:16:22,341 --> 00:16:23,557
Ah well here it is!  An announcement!

203
00:16:25,803 --> 00:16:29,195
Is there any way
to do a kill properly?

204
00:16:30,383 --> 00:16:32,327
Romans!

205
00:16:32,494 --> 00:16:38,344
You've had enough, enough of the atmosphere
filled with the city, the noise...

206
00:16:38,344 --> 00:16:40,700
Frenzy, traffic?!

207
00:16:41,007 --> 00:16:41,989
Not really...

208
00:16:43,003 --> 00:16:48,885
A new city is waiting
for you, less than

209
00:16:48,885 --> 00:16:51,808
three weeks from
the center of Rome!

210
00:16:51,808 --> 00:16:56,361
The divine Caesar will offer,
this evening, to one of you...

211
00:16:56,361 --> 00:16:58,284
A splendid apartment in the...

212
00:16:58,531 --> 00:16:59,971
DOMAIN OF THE GODS!

213
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:06,980
Consult unpublish
who is at your feet!

214
00:17:08,399 --> 00:17:09,685
But it's beautiful!

215
00:17:10,088 --> 00:17:11,888
But, it's in Armorica...

216
00:17:12,033 --> 00:17:14,124
Where is Armorica?
- I don't know but, it's far!

217
00:17:14,684 --> 00:17:16,527
That the big draw...

218
00:17:17,024 --> 00:17:18,024
BEGIN!!!

219
00:17:34,293 --> 00:17:35,973
The lucky winner...

220
00:17:37,216 --> 00:17:38,896
Is... the holder...

221
00:17:40,057 --> 00:17:41,737
From unpublishable number...

222
00:17:44,588 --> 00:17:45,588
II!!!

223
00:17:47,205 --> 00:17:48,259
But... But it's you!

224
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:50,093
Quick, get down, get down!!

225
00:17:50,781 --> 00:17:51,957
I can't go to Armorica!

226
00:17:53,384 --> 00:17:55,117
SO?  Who has number II?

227
00:17:56,191 --> 00:17:58,742
It's us!  It's here!
It's that person!

228
00:17:58,881 --> 00:18:00,948
What did we win?  A gladiator?

229
00:18:02,288 --> 00:18:04,432
We cheer loudly as he
descends from the arena!

230
00:18:07,908 --> 00:18:11,812
Oh look how handsome your father is!
Looks like a Greek hero!

231
00:18:12,622 --> 00:18:15,011
Bravo, Bravo!

232
00:18:16,263 --> 00:18:18,663
Smile, show your number and smile!

233
00:18:21,676 --> 00:18:24,637
Where is Armorica again?
- In Gaul.

234
00:18:25,129 --> 00:18:27,329
Oh yes!  It's a long way, though.

235
00:18:28,008 --> 00:18:29,844
So, if I don't want to go to Armorica?

236
00:18:29,844 --> 00:18:32,577
So you stay here and we unleash the lions.

237
00:18:48,131 --> 00:18:49,811
Oh yeah!  Effectively.

238
00:18:51,319 --> 00:18:53,895
There, you have to admit that Roman
architecture is awfully impressive!

239
00:18:54,739 --> 00:18:56,510
If I understand
correctly, this is the lobby!

240
00:18:56,872 --> 00:18:59,753
[they laugh.]

241
00:18:59,951 --> 00:19:01,303
Good.  We will stop the charges.

242
00:19:03,061 --> 00:19:05,461
We will say that the fun is over.

243
00:19:05,702 --> 00:19:06,902
NEVER NEVER

244
00:19:07,381 --> 00:19:10,718
CAESAR HAS ENTRUSTED ME WITH A
MISSION AND I WILL BRING IT TO THE END

245
00:19:10,856 --> 00:19:14,184
I WILL MAKE THE
TAAACHEEEE SLAAAAVEES DIE

246
00:19:16,187 --> 00:19:18,249
To kill the slaves on the job?

247
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:21,063
We keep replanting the
trees, that's what will happen.

248
00:19:21,383 --> 00:19:22,909
What can we do, Getafix?

249
00:19:22,909 --> 00:19:23,949
We think.

250
00:19:31,095 --> 00:19:33,979
I have an idea, but you're
not going to accept it.

251
00:19:34,137 --> 00:19:35,137
What if we gave the Romans
a good general beating?

252
00:19:35,713 --> 00:19:37,234
So!  That was my idea.

253
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:39,524
To protect the slaves, I have a plan.

254
00:19:39,675 --> 00:19:43,387
It requires a beating,
but fortunately a tiny one.

255
00:19:44,421 --> 00:19:46,621
A little beating?
That exists?

256
00:19:48,584 --> 00:19:49,784
Rock, paper, scissors!  Oh.

257
00:19:50,134 --> 00:19:51,134
Rock, paper, scissors!

258
00:19:53,931 --> 00:19:55,211
Excuse me, slave clan, please.

259
00:19:58,155 --> 00:19:59,155
HELLO!!

260
00:19:59,502 --> 00:20:02,734
YOU CAN'T KNOW
I'M IN A GOOD MOOD!

261
00:20:42,854 --> 00:20:46,566
Here is a potion that gives
superhuman strength. Just for you.

262
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:47,943
I can take it to
try if it works?

263
00:20:47,943 --> 00:20:48,872
No.

264
00:20:49,464 --> 00:20:53,624
All that remains is to mutiny
and flee.  You are free.

265
00:20:54,009 --> 00:20:56,343
So I would like to say thank you, but

266
00:20:56,929 --> 00:20:59,254
Is the flee really a way out?

267
00:20:59,254 --> 00:21:02,628
You talk about
flee, but isn't flee...

268
00:21:02,628 --> 00:21:05,647
Another way of slavery?

269
00:21:06,389 --> 00:21:08,606
It would rather be the
beginning of a form of freedom...

270
00:21:08,606 --> 00:21:10,743
AND YET!  No flee without oppression!

271
00:21:10,743 --> 00:21:12,696
I tease a little, but admit that
there is a matter for debate!

272
00:21:13,028 --> 00:21:15,282
I just want to give you a potion.

273
00:21:15,282 --> 00:21:17,132
I hear well.  I just want to go back to--

274
00:21:17,311 --> 00:21:19,386
YOU TAKE THE POTION OR
YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS!!

275
00:21:19,527 --> 00:21:20,255
Absolutely.

276
00:21:30,371 --> 00:21:31,296
What happened?

277
00:21:31,296 --> 00:21:34,931
A beautiful testimony from our
Gaulish friends.

278
00:21:37,891 --> 00:21:40,091
Oh no, you, I don't have time!

279
00:21:44,877 --> 00:21:45,877
Ouch.

280
00:21:54,458 --> 00:21:58,106
So, starting today, we
will receive a balance

281
00:21:58,587 --> 00:22:01,172
equal to the legionnaires:
holidays, 2 meals a day...

282
00:22:01,434 --> 00:22:02,248
Thirteen.  - How?

283
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:04,913
Three.
- Ah yes, three meals a day.

284
00:22:05,331 --> 00:22:09,427
When the first building in the
Domain of the Gods is built...

285
00:22:09,906 --> 00:22:11,590
We want to be set free.
- Huh?

286
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:13,323
Free.
- Oh yes, free.

287
00:22:13,824 --> 00:22:16,317
We demand housing for everyone
in the building we have built.

288
00:22:17,403 --> 00:22:18,695
It's the most.  - Here!

289
00:22:18,695 --> 00:22:19,695
Hush!

290
00:22:20,941 --> 00:22:24,013
You won't accept this?
- Yes, it seems prudent.

291
00:22:24,279 --> 00:22:25,399
Deal?

292
00:22:59,107 --> 00:23:00,787
Oh yeah!  Effectively.

293
00:23:01,325 --> 00:23:04,662
You have to admit that Roman
architecture is awfully impressive.

294
00:23:05,215 --> 00:23:07,015
Yeah, that's a good job.
- What are you doing here?

295
00:23:07,521 --> 00:23:13,575
Centurion, we saw you give
the slaves the same pay as us!?

296
00:23:13,884 --> 00:23:16,828
Obviously, we
confirm those are lies!

297
00:23:19,294 --> 00:23:20,334
It's mine.  - No!

298
00:23:20,334 --> 00:23:21,334
[they argue.]

299
00:23:43,268 --> 00:23:45,072
But what are you making? If we

300
00:23:45,073 --> 00:23:46,877
gave the potion, it's
for you to run away!

301
00:23:47,434 --> 00:23:50,554
We discussed it and it seems
like the condition of fugitive slavery

302
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:53,641
Does not represent the
prospect of a good career.

303
00:23:53,641 --> 00:23:55,400
What more do you
want, by Toutatis?

304
00:23:55,707 --> 00:23:59,422
In all simplicity, to become
free Roman citizens.

305
00:23:59,422 --> 00:24:00,813
And for that, we want
to finish this building.

306
00:24:01,774 --> 00:24:03,649
WE CANNOT LET YOU
DESTROY OUR FOREST.

307
00:24:04,152 --> 00:24:05,280
THIS JOKE IS ENOUGH.

308
00:24:05,573 --> 00:24:07,473
GET YOUR MEN AWAY.  WHEN
WE COME BACK IT WILL BE

309
00:24:07,473 --> 00:24:09,153
TO DESTROY THIS SITE

310
00:24:22,324 --> 00:24:23,825
EVERYONE HAS BEEN SERVED CHILDREN?

311
00:24:24,001 --> 00:24:24,944
YEEEEEEEEESSS!!!!

312
00:24:24,944 --> 00:24:25,731
No.

313
00:24:26,162 --> 00:24:27,932
Okay, a little silence for my speech.

314
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:31,894
You don't even know what to hit!

315
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,201
WE DON'T CARE!

316
00:24:33,354 --> 00:24:34,043
As long as we hit!

317
00:24:34,189 --> 00:24:36,789
What needs to be demolished
most of all is a large building--

318
00:24:36,876 --> 00:24:39,609
WE BREAK EVERYTHING ON OUR
PATH AND IT WILL GO!

319
00:25:03,152 --> 00:25:03,670
Greu!

320
00:25:11,017 --> 00:25:13,788
44, You follow me!
- Hey, you forgot 43!

321
00:25:13,893 --> 00:25:15,573
43 is entry C!

322
00:25:16,861 --> 00:25:17,901
Civilians...

323
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:22,706
Oh look, a little costume
animation to keep us waiting!

324
00:25:28,498 --> 00:25:29,858
Come here, my baby.

325
00:25:33,834 --> 00:25:36,047
Can we smash the big house?
- No.

326
00:25:36,819 --> 00:25:39,353
Well, a column, anyway.
- No!

327
00:25:39,749 --> 00:25:42,149
The little cart, at least!
- No!!

328
00:25:42,569 --> 00:25:47,433
CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT THE ROMANS
ARE FOR IF WE CAN'T HIT THEM!?

329
00:25:52,821 --> 00:25:54,501
We're going back home.

330
00:26:05,395 --> 00:26:07,366
What I need
is your title deed.

331
00:26:08,044 --> 00:26:11,714
But it's *that*, my title deed!
- We were entrusted with it by Caesar!

332
00:26:11,837 --> 00:26:13,091
I don't know what you need!

333
00:26:13,228 --> 00:26:14,713
Listen, Petirectus.
- Petiminus.

334
00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:16,147
Petinus.  I can't--

335
00:26:16,304 --> 00:26:19,651
Say!  If you keep fidgeting,
we're not gonna make it!

336
00:26:19,651 --> 00:26:25,084
It's long, huh!
- Mosaic is nothing new.

337
00:26:29,573 --> 00:26:31,255
This mosaic has a problem.
- Pardon?

338
00:26:31,964 --> 00:26:34,636
It's way too big and you
haven't consolidated it by area.

339
00:26:35,595 --> 00:26:37,168
This mosaic is perfect, Peticitrus.
- Petiminus.

340
00:26:37,357 --> 00:26:40,959
Petinus. I can't assign you
accommodation. Thanks, have a good day.

341
00:26:40,959 --> 00:26:43,859
But anyway, we
did weeks of travel!

342
00:26:44,376 --> 00:26:47,077
Come back tomorrow with
a complete file. Next!

343
00:26:52,542 --> 00:26:54,675
Come on, go, you, I'm busy.

344
00:26:56,542 --> 00:26:57,542
AHH!!

345
00:27:06,776 --> 00:27:08,456
Lost in Armorica...

346
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:18,372
Look: he lifts a column
on his own!  Tadaam!

347
00:27:45,017 --> 00:27:47,217
Can... can I play with the dog?

348
00:27:48,487 --> 00:27:52,661
Of course! He is very good at
fetching sticks.  Huh, Idefix?

349
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:57,849
Well, to bring back menhirs, I'm
trying to train it but it's not yet easy.

350
00:28:01,953 --> 00:28:03,753
Come on Idefix! Fetch!

351
00:28:04,618 --> 00:28:07,075
Wow...! Hercule!

352
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:10,728
We still have no luck.
- What will happen to us?

353
00:28:15,666 --> 00:28:17,655
Dad, Mom, I found Hercule!!

354
00:28:18,135 --> 00:28:19,335
Where, Hercule?

355
00:28:20,534 --> 00:28:22,867
Apeljus!
- Spare the Gaul child!

356
00:28:29,006 --> 00:28:30,311
I HAVE UNDERSTOOD YOU!

357
00:28:30,763 --> 00:28:33,698
About what?
- Uh, in general.

358
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,402
Y'all are--
- THE SOUP IS GOING TO BE COLD!

359
00:28:35,572 --> 00:28:36,859
One minute, mimine...

360
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:41,306
You are all very disappointed, here,
not to have the right to a good fight...

361
00:28:41,453 --> 00:28:43,848
We took the magic potion for nothing!
[everyone approves]

362
00:28:45,422 --> 00:28:49,260
If I meet a Roman civilian in
the forest, I'll give him a look

363
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,197
WHO WILL TELL EVERYTHING!
- Me me me!

364
00:28:51,593 --> 00:28:53,847
If a Roman civilian asks
me the way, I'll show him.

365
00:28:53,847 --> 00:28:55,899
BUT HE WILL NOT COME UP
THE CURRENCY OF HIS PIECE!

366
00:28:57,381 --> 00:29:00,315
If there is someone who helps me
carry my basket, I will say thank you.

367
00:29:00,814 --> 00:29:02,639
BUT THAT WILL NOT BE SINCERE!!

368
00:29:07,517 --> 00:29:12,189
It's friends.  They don't know how
to go with a key of I don't know what.

369
00:29:12,879 --> 00:29:16,131
It is the best!  The last
time a Roman set foot here,

370
00:29:16,131 --> 00:29:17,731
I wasn't even born!

371
00:29:19,937 --> 00:29:24,376
I'm sorry, but this looks
like a tiny attempt at invasion.

372
00:29:24,376 --> 00:29:26,083
ATTACK INVADERS, CHILDREN!!

373
00:29:27,979 --> 00:29:30,879
But where did you see
invaders?  It's a lost family!

374
00:29:31,157 --> 00:29:32,198
But, mimine...

375
00:29:37,682 --> 00:29:40,415
Come on, come eat.  There's lukewarm soup.

376
00:29:52,983 --> 00:29:56,247
Asterix.  Village warrior.
- Petiminus, mosaicist.

377
00:30:09,768 --> 00:30:11,701
Alright then, so what do we do?

378
00:30:11,809 --> 00:30:12,226
About what?

379
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:15,267
In the Domain of the Gods,
we don't hit the civilians, all that.

380
00:30:16,132 --> 00:30:18,098
Because in the meantime,
the work continues!

381
00:30:18,283 --> 00:30:19,836
That means more will come!

382
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:25,229
We have to find a way to get rid
of the civilians without hitting them.

383
00:30:32,903 --> 00:30:34,669
It's time, let's go, Obelix!

384
00:30:45,031 --> 00:30:48,982
And I raise my horn to the health of
the residents of the Domain of the Gods!

385
00:30:52,443 --> 00:30:55,358
Ahh, anyway!  Finally
the famous Armorican rain!

386
00:30:55,358 --> 00:30:58,041
When I thought when this moment
in Rome it would be all heat!

387
00:31:08,066 --> 00:31:09,503
Ave.
- Hi.

388
00:31:12,556 --> 00:31:15,165
IT'S FRESH!  IT'S A FRESH FISH!!

389
00:31:15,165 --> 00:31:16,946
How much are you selling your macro for?

390
00:31:18,033 --> 00:31:19,471
Uuuhh, 1 sestertius.

391
00:31:19,471 --> 00:31:22,679
A sestertius?  In Rome, they sell us at 5
- FIVE!?!?

392
00:31:22,847 --> 00:31:26,484
Ah oh no, no, it's uhh one.

393
00:31:26,484 --> 00:31:29,384
It may be because we
have the sea next door.

394
00:31:29,563 --> 00:31:31,184
And in Rome, we don't have the sea nearby.

395
00:31:31,184 --> 00:31:33,330
In Rome, we have the sea, but it is dirty.

396
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:33,981
I take three.

397
00:31:42,337 --> 00:31:43,076
Are you proud of yourself?

398
00:31:43,246 --> 00:31:45,445
What?  I should have
refused to sell to Romans?

399
00:31:46,903 --> 00:31:51,210
Do you realize that you would sell your
macro for 5 sesterces if you were in Rome?

400
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,264
Incomplete file. Next!

401
00:32:08,178 --> 00:32:10,777
So what's going on?
- I don't know, we can't see anything!

402
00:32:10,981 --> 00:32:13,989
You know what's going on?
- No, we can't see anything!

403
00:32:16,254 --> 00:32:18,873
Well, we'll try to
sleep, anyway!

404
00:32:18,873 --> 00:32:20,698
Anyway, it could never
be worse than in Rome!

405
00:32:22,217 --> 00:32:24,750
And there, there is the
rain which refreshes!

406
00:32:26,528 --> 00:32:27,528
Ave.
- Hi.

407
00:32:31,734 --> 00:32:35,462
Special Domain of the Gods: 4 sesterces
the macro!  4!  Cheaper than in Rome!

408
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,026
Oh!  This shield looks lovely!

409
00:32:39,333 --> 00:32:41,847
Ahhh, be careful:
it's not everyone's.

410
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:46,237
This is a real shield that
belonged to Vercingetorix himself.

411
00:32:47,118 --> 00:32:50,231
You make this every week
and sell it like it belongs to him!

412
00:32:50,231 --> 00:32:53,127
Well, your fish is starting
to mummify there!

413
00:32:55,378 --> 00:32:56,438
Incomplete file.

414
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:58,519
Ne-xt.

415
00:33:06,504 --> 00:33:09,717
You know what's going on, do you?
- No, we don't see anything!

416
00:33:10,652 --> 00:33:12,927
Well, we'll try to sleep anyway!

417
00:33:12,927 --> 00:33:15,514
Anyway, it could never
be worse than in Rome!

418
00:33:16,276 --> 00:33:18,810
And there, there is the
rain which refreshes!

419
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:21,128
Ave.
- Hi.

420
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:27,567
How much do you do it for?

421
00:33:28,341 --> 00:33:29,999
Special Domain of the Gods: 40 sesterces.

422
00:33:30,723 --> 00:33:32,613
THIS IS WHAT WE WILL SEE
WITH THE FAKE VERCINGETORIX

423
00:33:32,613 --> 00:33:34,482
IT WOULD BE WORTH TRIPLE, ANDOUILLE

424
00:33:34,482 --> 00:33:36,683
BECAUSE, FIRST: I DO WHAT I WANT

425
00:33:36,683 --> 00:33:39,378
AND SECOND, WHAT IS TRIPLE 40?

426
00:33:39,483 --> 00:33:42,004
That's 120 sesterces,
and at that price, I buy!

427
00:33:43,579 --> 00:33:44,364
THIS IS TOO STRONG!

428
00:33:44,572 --> 00:33:47,346
THEN SAY YOUR FISH
COMES FROM VERCINGETORIX!

429
00:33:49,881 --> 00:33:56,479
[they fight]

430
00:34:03,933 --> 00:34:06,067
We got it, we got it, we got it!

431
00:34:09,531 --> 00:34:10,531
We got it!

432
00:34:19,985 --> 00:34:28,246
Good morning, good morning, good morning.

433
00:34:28,246 --> 00:34:31,113
Impressive!  So, *very* impressive.

434
00:34:31,507 --> 00:34:33,187
All on time...

435
00:34:40,447 --> 00:34:42,860
Centurion?
- Nonono, later.

436
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:44,961
Yes, but we won't be there later...

437
00:34:44,961 --> 00:34:45,598
What is happening?

438
00:34:47,063 --> 00:34:49,469
I promised to set them free,
but I didn't have the authority.

439
00:34:49,665 --> 00:34:51,518
Did you promise to set them free?

440
00:34:51,518 --> 00:34:54,328
AND HE PAID THEM!  AND HE GAVE THEM
A DWELLING IN THE DOMAIN OF THE GODS

441
00:34:54,328 --> 00:34:55,232
TO EVERYONE!
- What?

442
00:34:55,926 --> 00:34:57,574
Well, without that, we would
have been fighting!

443
00:34:58,776 --> 00:35:00,136
Let me handle this.

444
00:35:03,744 --> 00:35:04,744
Slaves!

445
00:35:05,254 --> 00:35:08,632
By the powers given to
me by Caesar and all that...

446
00:35:11,326 --> 00:35:13,006
Hop!  I set you free.

447
00:35:13,747 --> 00:35:15,057
So we are free?
- Yes.

448
00:35:15,057 --> 00:35:18,086
Ahhh! Ah well I can tell you
that we're glad to hear it.

449
00:35:19,627 --> 00:35:22,802
You will not forget to return
the keys of your accommodations.

450
00:35:23,711 --> 00:35:25,994
We had thought that we had
a housing assigned to each...

451
00:35:26,195 --> 00:35:30,362
When you were slaves!
Because now you have to pay 15

452
00:35:30,523 --> 00:35:33,467
rent sesterces per week.
- 15 sesterces?

453
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,387
BUT!  Good news:

454
00:35:35,694 --> 00:35:39,004
We have jobs for construction
workers that have just become available!

455
00:35:39,004 --> 00:35:41,071
The salary is therefore...
15 sesterces a week.

456
00:35:41,413 --> 00:35:44,336
You accept?
- Well... it's a proposal--

457
00:35:44,336 --> 00:35:46,070
Perfect!  You are engaged.

458
00:35:46,293 --> 00:35:49,237
Anglegus, your
workers are not at work.

459
00:35:50,394 --> 00:35:53,141
WORK, LAZY BANDS!!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING LOUNGE

460
00:35:53,141 --> 00:35:55,071
WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU
WILL BE PAID FOR!? GO!

461
00:35:55,071 --> 00:35:56,152
GO TO CONSTRUCTION!!!

462
00:35:58,407 --> 00:36:00,140
But this is slavery!

463
00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:05,063
I have to admit, you are efficient.

464
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,720
I am a senator.

465
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:13,053
THEY ARE NEW, THE
ANTIQUES, THEY ARE NEW!

466
00:36:13,393 --> 00:36:16,337
OLD MATERIALS:
CONTACT THE SPECIALIST!

467
00:36:16,893 --> 00:36:19,013
FROM FATHER TO SON SINCE VERCINGETORIX!

468
00:36:19,013 --> 00:36:20,858
7 SESTERCES THE MACRO, 7 SESTERCES

469
00:36:20,858 --> 00:36:23,715
6 SESTERCES 99 THE MACRO!  6 SESTERCES 99!

470
00:36:31,371 --> 00:36:33,429
But I tell you this
shield is not for sale!

471
00:36:34,221 --> 00:36:37,991
Even for 450 sesterces?
- It's to offer?  I wrap it up for you.

472
00:36:45,474 --> 00:36:46,597
You will give us 2 fish, please.

473
00:36:46,809 --> 00:36:48,489
You eat fish now?

474
00:36:48,542 --> 00:36:52,572
We have to, there are no
wild boars in the forest now.

475
00:36:53,885 --> 00:36:56,399
That will be 14 sesterces.
- WHAT!?  It's a joke.

476
00:36:56,632 --> 00:37:01,646
Why not raise the price?  We are even
a little more expensive than in Rome!

477
00:37:01,646 --> 00:37:03,805
This is theft!!  Lower
your price immediately.

478
00:37:04,114 --> 00:37:05,401
This is my price!  To do what?

479
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:08,736
Even with 7 sestertii,
my fish is selling well.

480
00:37:10,094 --> 00:37:11,294
I take one.

481
00:37:11,897 --> 00:37:13,764
One macro for two?
- Yes.

482
00:37:20,141 --> 00:37:23,332
And the fish, we leave it?  Because
we really have nothing to eat!

483
00:37:35,417 --> 00:37:37,943
Mister Asterix prevents
us from hitting the civilians...

484
00:37:37,943 --> 00:37:40,426
And when we welcome them into our
home, they want us to send them back.

485
00:37:40,426 --> 00:37:42,863
You are ridiculous with
your macros at 7 sesterces!

486
00:37:43,325 --> 00:37:44,934
You must stop this
circus immediately!

487
00:37:45,239 --> 00:37:46,554
And that you help us!

488
00:37:46,705 --> 00:37:49,775
Help you with what exactly?
- To make the Romans...

489
00:37:49,775 --> 00:37:52,915
...go home so we can raze
the Domain of the Gods!

490
00:37:54,663 --> 00:37:55,703
Perfectly.

491
00:37:58,524 --> 00:37:59,964
...and the customers?

492
00:38:01,885 --> 00:38:04,992
Asterix, I don't see why we
shouldn't grow our business!

493
00:38:05,139 --> 00:38:08,432
The bad thing is you've
become a bunch of greedy fools.

494
00:38:08,432 --> 00:38:11,415
It's wrong!  We were already
fools long before the Romans...

495
00:38:11,415 --> 00:38:14,351
Exact!  And we don't risk being
greedy, we don't know what that means!

496
00:38:16,337 --> 00:38:19,494
Good.  Don't worry.  I
won't give you any problem.

497
00:38:20,635 --> 00:38:22,835
I'm moving to the Domain of the Gods.

498
00:38:23,724 --> 00:38:26,001
Me too.  (x2)

499
00:38:26,001 --> 00:38:29,604
I won't stay a second in a
village that I no longer recognize.

500
00:38:36,319 --> 00:38:39,889
I know I'm overdoing it, but
isn't it time for a farewell song?

501
00:38:45,087 --> 00:38:47,124
SINCE IT'S LIKE THIS, ME TOO I'M
GOING TO THE DOMAIN OF THE GODS.

502
00:38:47,124 --> 00:38:50,493
Perhaps the Romans know how to
welcome an artist.  And I can tell you--

503
00:38:50,493 --> 00:38:52,656
Assurancetourix, if you
want to leave, it's now.

504
00:38:53,793 --> 00:38:55,393
BRIEF!  I AM OUTRAGED!

505
00:39:11,869 --> 00:39:13,077
Romans, we want an accommodation.

506
00:39:13,077 --> 00:39:15,997
An accommodation? Really??

507
00:39:16,142 --> 00:39:18,517
We just want an accommodation.

508
00:39:18,517 --> 00:39:20,661
But come on, I-- s-- it's impossible--

509
00:39:20,661 --> 00:39:26,746
Hello Hello!!
Good morning.  Welcome.

510
00:39:26,746 --> 00:39:29,012
We will make you happy!
- What!?

511
00:39:32,157 --> 00:39:34,862
Anglegus, you're
dumber than you think.

512
00:39:34,862 --> 00:39:38,254
But finally, we are not
going to welcome Gauls here!

513
00:39:40,316 --> 00:39:43,761
What will Caesar say if he learns that
the Gauls want to live like Romans?

514
00:39:43,761 --> 00:39:47,024
What will Caesar say if he sees
the madmen deserting their village?

515
00:39:47,513 --> 00:39:52,184
What will Caesar say if he realizes his
plan is going 1000x better than expected!?

516
00:39:52,184 --> 00:39:54,187
But I have no free accommodation!

517
00:39:54,617 --> 00:39:55,377
Make room.

518
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:58,315
No problem!! We'll think about it.

519
00:40:03,773 --> 00:40:05,840
Finally... we are finally home.

520
00:40:08,949 --> 00:40:09,949
Come in!

521
00:40:22,883 --> 00:40:25,083
What shall we do now?
- Do you have an idea, Asterix?

522
00:40:25,849 --> 00:40:26,849
I need the night to revise.

523
00:40:30,129 --> 00:40:32,462
This house looks like a box.

524
00:40:33,262 --> 00:40:35,195
It's an apartment, Obelix.

525
00:40:35,562 --> 00:40:39,967
If we knew which box Apeljus and his
parents are, we could say hello to them.

526
00:40:50,904 --> 00:40:54,687
Magnificent...Magnificent!

527
00:40:55,367 --> 00:40:57,047
The poison works.

528
00:40:58,553 --> 00:41:01,849
We must strike!  Let it be known in
Armorica that the inhabitants of the

529
00:41:01,849 --> 00:41:06,339
rebellious village are all entitled to
accommodation at the Domain of the Gods.

530
00:41:07,163 --> 00:41:08,603
Free, and for life!

531
00:41:36,238 --> 00:41:43,545
A magnificent free accommodation
awaits every family in the village at...

532
00:41:43,545 --> 00:41:44,545
THE DOMAIN OF THE GODS!?!?

533
00:41:45,127 --> 00:41:46,234
A free accomodation!?

534
00:41:46,234 --> 00:41:50,292
Me, if it allows me to never see your faces
more, I'm not going any later than now!

535
00:41:52,228 --> 00:41:54,663
I can say that a little civilization
will make me a vacation.

536
00:41:54,663 --> 00:41:56,699
Because with your
fish and things...

537
00:41:56,699 --> 00:41:59,815
But, I'm the village chief, mimine.
We can't go to the Domain of the Gods!

538
00:41:59,815 --> 00:42:02,082
I didn't say I would go with you!

539
00:42:04,232 --> 00:42:14,799
[they start arguing.]

540
00:42:14,799 --> 00:42:22,003
[they argue.]

541
00:42:32,051 --> 00:42:34,375
What do i do?  I go?
- Yes!

542
00:42:34,375 --> 00:42:37,158
Go ahead!
- Are you sure that I shouldn't

543
00:42:37,158 --> 00:42:38,592
start with a light little song?

544
00:42:38,592 --> 00:42:40,528
Huh, as an intro?
- No no no.

545
00:42:40,528 --> 00:42:43,785
Attack directly, with
something powerful.

546
00:42:43,785 --> 00:42:47,625
It's a new audience, you
have to make an impression!

547
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:50,593
Go for powerful.

548
00:42:56,440 --> 00:43:33,162
[horrible chanting, screams]

549
00:43:44,295 --> 00:43:47,695
After deliberation, we decided to
move into the Domain of the Gods

550
00:43:47,919 --> 00:43:50,178
To bring us closer to
your beloved customers.

551
00:43:50,178 --> 00:43:53,638
As such, we begin by discouraging
any attempt at a welcome chant.

552
00:43:53,782 --> 00:43:58,847
Note that the macros will
always be at 7 sesterces!

553
00:43:59,976 --> 00:44:00,976
Let's go!

554
00:44:05,563 --> 00:44:07,363
They are crazy, these Gauls.

555
00:44:07,815 --> 00:44:09,139
I feel like it's calmed down.

556
00:44:27,522 --> 00:44:29,202
Obelix?
- You're here?

557
00:44:34,904 --> 00:44:37,976
We didn't know where to go.
- You did well.

558
00:44:59,528 --> 00:45:02,128
[this is my favorite part of the movie]

559
00:47:09,634 --> 00:47:10,634
I'm hungry.

560
00:47:15,732 --> 00:47:21,855
[evil laugh]

561
00:47:24,349 --> 00:47:25,394
What did I say?

562
00:47:25,950 --> 00:47:26,744
At what moment?

563
00:47:26,744 --> 00:47:28,073
Right here right now.

564
00:47:28,073 --> 00:47:30,687
You were laughing devilishly.

565
00:47:30,687 --> 00:47:31,618
Evil, even.

566
00:47:31,618 --> 00:47:32,618
No before!

567
00:47:36,679 --> 00:47:38,359
Didn't you say "Finally"?

568
00:47:38,921 --> 00:47:41,410
Finally, I have them, these
irreducible Gauls.

569
00:47:41,410 --> 00:47:44,692
After all these years of
humiliation, it only took four buildings

570
00:47:44,692 --> 00:47:48,352
for the knowledge.
- Magnificent, O Caesar.

571
00:47:48,352 --> 00:47:50,966
Our victory over Gaul is total!!
- No.

572
00:47:50,966 --> 00:47:55,782
It will only be complete when there
is no longer a part of their village left.

573
00:47:56,033 --> 00:47:57,033
OUCH!!

574
00:47:59,753 --> 00:48:01,433
Modification of plans.

575
00:48:02,302 --> 00:48:03,982
We have a village to raze.

576
00:48:05,410 --> 00:48:06,850
[evil laugh]

577
00:48:08,684 --> 00:48:09,574
That's diabolical...

578
00:48:09,574 --> 00:48:10,934
No.  Maleficent...

579
00:48:18,343 --> 00:48:19,343
Over there!

580
00:48:23,399 --> 00:48:24,399
Did we see one?
- No.

581
00:48:24,516 --> 00:48:26,663
So why are you turning?
- To change corners!

582
00:48:26,833 --> 00:48:28,253
There was nothing there.

583
00:48:28,253 --> 00:48:29,253
Over there!

584
00:48:38,174 --> 00:48:41,173
No.  Still no boar.

585
00:48:41,173 --> 00:48:43,573
They left because of the works.

586
00:49:02,951 --> 00:49:03,951
Well then?

587
00:49:05,043 --> 00:49:06,723
I am too tired.

588
00:49:07,098 --> 00:49:08,618
I am going to rest.

589
00:49:10,626 --> 00:49:12,171
It's because you're hungry.
- You think?

590
00:49:12,171 --> 00:49:14,420
Does it happen when you
don't eat for a long time?

591
00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:15,540
I dunno...

592
00:49:18,261 --> 00:49:21,781
Do not worry.  I'm going to
look for a boar all by myself.

593
00:49:22,974 --> 00:49:24,654
Don't go too far!

594
00:49:36,226 --> 00:49:37,226
Idefix!

595
00:49:39,883 --> 00:49:40,883
Oh!

596
00:49:47,153 --> 00:49:48,273
CHAAAARGEEEEEZ

597
00:49:52,693 --> 00:49:54,223
Well, what are you doing?

598
00:49:55,096 --> 00:49:58,168
We don't care for having voted
for the general strike!

599
00:50:00,633 --> 00:50:03,221
We believe this assault
is potentially dangerous!

600
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:06,061
It's good!  It's an assault, we
raze a village, it's not dangerous!

601
00:50:12,528 --> 00:50:18,183
The old druid must be neutralized
so that the Gauls have no more potion!

602
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:38,969
The soldiers, they want...

603
00:50:38,969 --> 00:50:41,375
...to destroy the village, yes.  I heard.

604
00:50:42,915 --> 00:50:44,435
*raze* the village.

605
00:50:44,546 --> 00:50:47,746
The exact way to say
it is *raze* the village.

606
00:50:48,094 --> 00:50:49,614
GET THEM!

607
00:50:49,703 --> 00:50:52,319
Centurion, we haven't settled our business!

608
00:50:52,448 --> 00:50:56,019
There he is, your druid, you talk about
him, and boom!  Directly on your pif!

609
00:50:56,019 --> 00:50:56,806
What more do you need?

610
00:50:56,806 --> 00:51:00,134
- We have not settled the
question of free accommodation!

611
00:51:04,353 --> 00:51:06,086
STOP THEM BY JUPITER!!!

612
00:51:13,628 --> 00:51:21,146
O, O... O Caesar, no building will
stand high enough, lofty enough!

613
00:51:27,171 --> 00:51:30,448
All accommodations are occupied.
We have to put it somewhere else.

614
00:51:30,448 --> 00:51:32,913
That's no reason to
put a prison in the lobby!

615
00:51:32,913 --> 00:51:37,393
If we don't put it inside,
the other Gauls will see it.

616
00:51:39,811 --> 00:51:42,737
A reception hall, a cage, at the
same time, what does it look like?

617
00:51:58,873 --> 00:52:01,979
Don't worry.
Someone will help us.

618
00:52:01,979 --> 00:52:04,952
I know Obelix is ​​going to smash everything.

619
00:52:04,952 --> 00:52:07,960
We have to find a
way to warn someone.

620
00:52:16,388 --> 00:52:18,188
Hey, up there!  No heckling!

621
00:52:22,145 --> 00:52:23,145
Hercules.

622
00:52:32,769 --> 00:52:35,646
You're smarter than I thought.

623
00:52:45,267 --> 00:52:50,323
But I won't be able to assign accommodation
to everyone at the Domain of the Gods!

624
00:53:09,979 --> 00:53:10,979
Apeljus?

625
00:53:24,743 --> 00:53:25,743
Panoramix?

626
00:53:31,907 --> 00:53:33,528
Something must have
happened to Apeljus.

627
00:53:33,528 --> 00:53:35,208
Apeljus is safe,
he's with Obelix--

628
00:53:38,740 --> 00:53:40,420
Are you with Apeljus?

629
00:53:41,493 --> 00:53:43,360
We have to go up the river!

630
00:54:12,446 --> 00:54:17,758
I have never seen a legion living in
a deluxe building, with wife and child.

631
00:54:21,389 --> 00:54:22,346
...and the fat Centurion?

632
00:54:23,137 --> 00:54:24,227
What fat Centurion?

633
00:54:24,227 --> 00:54:26,056
No. And the FAT Centurion!

634
00:54:26,056 --> 00:54:27,831
But how fat are you talking about?

635
00:54:27,831 --> 00:54:30,435
The fat Gaul with superhuman
strength who doesn't need a potion!

636
00:54:30,435 --> 00:54:31,875
He is still running!

637
00:54:44,370 --> 00:54:45,890
I'm hungry !

638
00:54:52,879 --> 00:54:54,746
Stop, you'll wake him up!

639
00:55:02,478 --> 00:55:05,435
Every time you have a prisoner,
you bring him to me in the hall!

640
00:55:12,926 --> 00:55:14,338
They got Obelix!

641
00:55:14,338 --> 00:55:16,569
You already told me that
for the two next to the mosaic!

642
00:55:16,569 --> 00:55:18,528
Hush!
- The mosaic that has a flaw!

643
00:55:18,528 --> 00:55:19,808
Hush!
- Shut up!

644
00:55:20,310 --> 00:55:23,638
SILENCE!  We need
to put it in a safe place.

645
00:56:24,809 --> 00:56:28,594
I don't understand!  We followed
the river and we didn't find him!

646
00:56:28,594 --> 00:56:30,594
We must have missed something.

647
00:56:47,044 --> 00:56:50,847
I hope this is not for nothing.

648
00:56:53,566 --> 00:56:55,788
Please!  We gather around me!

649
00:57:01,562 --> 00:57:07,884
We have the chance to
show you a completely rare event!

650
00:57:28,297 --> 00:57:33,260
CHAAAAARGEEE PLEASE

651
00:57:39,918 --> 00:57:42,185
BE KIND TO HIIIIIIIIIT

652
00:57:56,336 --> 00:57:57,336
Ah!

653
00:57:59,368 --> 00:58:01,302
Do something!!!

654
00:58:01,742 --> 00:58:02,862
What do I do!?

655
00:58:04,608 --> 00:58:05,888
What Centurion!?

656
00:58:22,592 --> 00:58:26,444
[he pretends to drink the potion.]

657
00:58:30,373 --> 00:58:46,832
[he pretends to have effects
of the magic potion.]

658
00:58:50,525 --> 00:58:52,792
BE NICE TO ATTACK THIS IDIOT!

659
00:58:53,996 --> 00:58:55,399
What?  I said "Be nice"!

660
00:58:55,399 --> 00:58:58,214
If he has the magic potion, no fight!

661
00:58:58,214 --> 00:59:01,798
That's why we locked the
druid in the Domain of the Gods!

662
00:59:01,936 --> 00:59:03,846
The Druid? What Druid?
- Ours?

663
00:59:03,846 --> 00:59:04,874
And the big one too!

664
00:59:04,874 --> 00:59:06,874
The big? What big?
- Ours?

665
00:59:07,476 --> 00:59:09,476
He just drank it, the little one.

666
00:59:13,092 --> 00:59:14,772
Fake?  in a gourd?

667
00:59:19,809 --> 00:59:21,876
Alright.
I understand, I'm going down.

668
00:59:38,395 --> 00:59:41,289
So, you have superhuman strength?
- Do you want a slap?

669
00:59:44,156 --> 00:59:45,156
Do it.

670
00:59:47,984 --> 00:59:51,568
My first slaps are first
reserved for the Romans.

671
00:59:51,961 --> 00:59:53,641
These in particular.

672
00:59:55,011 --> 00:59:57,467
Are you proud of yourself,
and your ridiculous clothes?

673
00:59:57,467 --> 00:59:59,534
"Roman civilians"...

674
00:59:59,692 --> 01:00:03,592
You, Abraracourcix, our chief, I
will teach you to desert your village.

675
01:00:03,592 --> 01:00:04,247
Huh?

676
01:00:04,820 --> 01:00:06,908
I will teach you to desert your village.

677
01:00:07,222 --> 01:00:08,189
I get it but--

678
01:00:08,189 --> 01:00:12,770
By giving you a slap whose power
is granted by the magic potion.

679
01:00:14,609 --> 01:00:16,876
Which I just drank just now.

680
01:00:18,931 --> 01:00:23,270
Are you ready to take a slap that will
send you to the other end of the forest.

681
01:00:38,193 --> 01:00:40,259
By Toutatis, what a power!

682
01:00:42,419 --> 01:00:44,619
This is for your not fresh fish!

683
01:00:50,234 --> 01:00:51,966
By Benos! What a knockout!

684
01:00:51,966 --> 01:00:53,833
And that's it for your Antiquities!

685
01:00:55,157 --> 01:00:56,157
Oooohh, Armorica,

686
01:00:56,158 --> 01:01:04,604
[i couldn't understand what he was saying]

687
01:01:10,379 --> 01:01:12,712
So he has the magic potion or not?

688
01:01:13,183 --> 01:01:16,255
They have it, they don't...
I'm destabilized.

689
01:01:16,262 --> 01:01:18,929
It is absolutely necessary that
I release Obélix and Panoramix.

690
01:01:18,929 --> 01:01:20,449
Occupy the Romans.

691
01:01:20,900 --> 01:01:23,800
Asterix, if you only
knew, I'm so ashamed!

692
01:01:24,221 --> 01:01:25,901
We'll see that later.

693
01:01:30,559 --> 01:01:33,652
Our dear village is threatened! It's now or

694
01:01:33,652 --> 01:01:37,748
never to drink a generous portion
of our famous magic potions!

695
01:01:42,268 --> 01:01:44,474
[they pretend effects of
the magic potion like idiots]

696
01:01:44,474 --> 01:01:50,377
Centurion, in military terms what do we do?
- I don't know, I'm destabilized.

697
01:02:08,934 --> 01:02:11,235
Apeljus is in this building
but everything is closed.

698
01:02:11,235 --> 01:02:12,969
Why in this building?

699
01:02:14,573 --> 01:02:16,573
Open up or I'll break down the door!!

700
01:02:16,893 --> 01:02:17,893
Dad!

701
01:02:23,217 --> 01:02:24,217
Panoramix!

702
01:02:24,944 --> 01:02:26,744
How many are in there?

703
01:03:06,291 --> 01:03:08,091
GUARD! GRAB THEM!

704
01:03:10,104 --> 01:03:11,784
Free the prisoners--

705
01:03:41,752 --> 01:03:44,759
When I tell you that your
mosaic has a defect...

706
01:03:45,795 --> 01:03:47,235
It's that it has...

707
01:03:48,103 --> 01:03:49,103
...A...

708
01:03:50,568 --> 01:03:51,568
...de...

709
01:03:52,588 --> 01:03:53,588
...fect!

710
01:04:08,814 --> 01:04:11,626
If the owl hoots,
someone isn't asleep.

711
01:04:12,339 --> 01:04:15,669
He who speaks without meaning
anything better be silent.

712
01:04:15,669 --> 01:04:16,882
And this one, you didn't steal it.

713
01:04:23,298 --> 01:04:24,978
What have you done with Obelix?

714
01:04:27,825 --> 01:04:31,766
We don't have time for
Obelix!  We need magic potion!

715
01:04:40,973 --> 01:04:43,773
Hey!  I was closed here, you forgot me?

716
01:04:56,610 --> 01:05:00,130
You've been chatting for
an hour, what are you doing?

717
01:05:01,029 --> 01:05:04,325
Let's admit that we fall back.
Are you going to follow us?

718
01:05:04,325 --> 01:05:06,005
Chances are, yes.

719
01:05:07,824 --> 01:05:10,656
Who is for the fallback?

720
01:05:10,656 --> 01:05:12,336
Who's for the fight?

721
01:05:14,747 --> 01:05:15,747
We fallback.

722
01:05:28,974 --> 01:05:29,974
We charge!!

723
01:06:02,168 --> 01:06:05,368
That is good.  No need.
Oh yes, I need that.

724
01:06:06,666 --> 01:06:07,866
What is that?

725
01:06:10,716 --> 01:06:12,396
Quick, Panoramix, quick!

726
01:06:35,785 --> 01:06:37,785
You don't take your accommodation?

727
01:06:40,568 --> 01:06:42,248
You took them all.

728
01:06:57,709 --> 01:06:59,643
Why are they out of breath?

729
01:06:59,681 --> 01:07:01,615
Usually, that never happens.

730
01:07:04,452 --> 01:07:07,526
What do you need just to know
they don't have the potion?

731
01:07:07,526 --> 01:07:08,526
A sign?

732
01:07:53,299 --> 01:07:55,499
What is all this madness?

733
01:08:29,163 --> 01:08:31,721
YOU THINK I CAME
HERE JUST TO EAT!?

734
01:08:32,410 --> 01:08:34,477
Not even a small tartlet?

735
01:08:34,807 --> 01:08:36,066
This is what i do to your tartlet!

736
01:08:36,151 --> 01:08:39,671
Get all this food out of here, immidiately!

737
01:08:51,315 --> 01:08:53,248
When Caesar says "we throw"...

738
01:08:54,342 --> 01:08:55,342
We throw.

739
01:08:56,110 --> 01:08:57,150
[he is crying]

740
01:09:09,127 --> 01:09:10,946
Stop these people immidiately!

741
01:09:17,334 --> 01:09:18,854
Almost, almost...

742
01:09:29,098 --> 01:09:31,765
Asterix, no!  The potion is not ready!

743
01:10:21,768 --> 01:10:26,312
You lost, Gaul.  This time, Rome
was stronger than your people.

744
01:10:31,106 --> 01:10:37,557
I am Asterix.  Gallic warrior.

745
01:10:38,383 --> 01:10:42,193
It's strange, I was told that all
the Gauls had become Romans.

746
01:10:42,193 --> 01:10:43,633
But they are!!

747
01:10:46,533 --> 01:10:49,133
Look, Caesar!  Your victory is complete!

748
01:10:49,570 --> 01:10:56,391
Contemplate your prisoners, the
mustache civilization is finally defeated!

749
01:10:56,829 --> 01:11:02,793
And this stupid arrogant little warrior
will now join his fat accomplice...

750
01:11:02,793 --> 01:11:03,793
In the dungeon!!

751
01:11:19,689 --> 01:11:21,715
I'm not...

752
01:11:21,715 --> 01:11:23,395
FAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT

753
01:11:34,739 --> 01:11:35,739
We charge!

754
01:11:39,324 --> 01:11:40,324
We charge!!

755
01:11:42,717 --> 01:11:44,517
Charge please!!!

756
01:11:52,751 --> 01:11:55,084
Open!  By order of Caesar, open!

757
01:11:55,896 --> 01:11:57,576
Is there help outside?

758
01:12:03,944 --> 01:12:05,624
We can say that, yes.

759
01:12:14,413 --> 01:12:15,413
Shoot!

760
01:12:27,151 --> 01:12:28,831
Be kind enough to--

761
01:12:48,138 --> 01:12:49,498
The final touch.

762
01:13:02,605 --> 01:13:05,528
YOU WILL NOT PASS!!

763
01:13:11,484 --> 01:13:14,218
Ah.
It's not going to be the same lemonade*.

764
01:13:41,485 --> 01:13:45,965
Friends!  We need more freedom
threatened by the sneaky tentacles!

765
01:13:59,601 --> 01:14:03,569
We hope you had a
pleasant time in Armorique.

766
01:14:12,733 --> 01:14:14,043
This one, Obelix, is for you.

767
01:14:14,043 --> 01:14:16,635
Of course it's for
me, I saw it first.

768
01:14:16,635 --> 01:14:18,772
Watch out, we're crossing!

769
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:28,120
GET BACK!!

770
01:14:33,394 --> 01:14:35,067
I demand the name of a manager!

771
01:14:35,067 --> 01:14:37,034
The manager's name is Cesar, ma'am.

772
01:14:57,453 --> 01:14:58,751
What are you doing??

773
01:14:58,751 --> 01:15:02,224
It's a long story.  Let's say that when
the construction site was finished,

774
01:15:02,224 --> 01:15:06,192
We had to think about a conversion.
And that's when we were offered--

775
01:15:06,866 --> 01:15:08,169
After a while it's fine.

776
01:15:18,269 --> 01:15:20,807
Wow...! Hercule!

777
01:15:37,630 --> 01:15:40,351
I don't know what you have in
store for me, Gaul, but I hope

778
01:15:40,351 --> 01:15:43,039
that you'll have dignity--
- You're stupid to talk about dignity.

779
01:15:43,666 --> 01:15:43,987
How?

780
01:15:44,299 --> 01:15:46,082
The Domain of the Gods
stunt doesn't look like you.

781
01:15:46,308 --> 01:15:49,226
It's sneaky, deceitful, and
calculated.  You should be ashamed.

782
01:15:50,002 --> 01:15:52,909
You know, we try things
huh, sometimes it works...

783
01:15:52,909 --> 01:15:54,560
- Sometimes it doesn't work.

784
01:15:54,731 --> 01:15:57,762
You will return to Rome
and take the civilians with you.

785
01:15:57,762 --> 01:15:59,969
I remind you that they
need a deluxe apartment.

786
01:16:00,235 --> 01:16:05,453
and...remember that there is a village
in Armorica that will resist you forever.

787
01:16:09,109 --> 01:16:10,109
Welp...

788
01:16:10,346 --> 01:16:12,594
[Latin]

789
01:16:12,594 --> 01:16:14,656
But hey, we can't live
here every time either.

790
01:16:14,656 --> 01:16:16,523
Come on, everyone in Rome!

791
01:16:49,625 --> 01:16:54,777
But I was told that I had fallen into
the magic potion when I was little.

792
01:16:54,777 --> 01:16:57,035
Yes yes.  We know.  A little try...

793
01:17:24,933 --> 01:17:28,869
Thank you for everything, Asterix.
Rome will seem to us faster now.

794
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:32,384
Hey, Petiminus, a little
souvenir from Armorica.

795
01:17:32,733 --> 01:17:35,333
With the compliments of the Gaul druid.

796
01:17:41,114 --> 01:17:43,181
Take this! It will make you a figurine.

797
01:17:43,641 --> 01:17:47,097
I'm sorry, that's all I could make.

798
01:18:04,549 --> 01:18:06,229
Watch out, a menhir!

799
01:18:06,716 --> 01:18:08,156
This is what you get!

800
01:18:11,476 --> 01:18:16,656
Tonight's program is
fan... it's fan-tastic!

801
01:18:20,145 --> 01:18:22,659
The small all dry, you
start with a blow to the hay.

802
01:18:22,659 --> 01:18:26,657
Afterwards, you turn around towards the big
bugger, and you do a sun projection on him.

803
01:18:26,657 --> 01:18:29,013
Do we agree that
I'm the big bugger?

804
01:18:29,013 --> 01:18:30,851
And hey there!  The shot of the robin.

805
01:18:31,230 --> 01:18:34,097
And we take it easy, not like training?

806
01:18:34,134 --> 01:18:35,915
What's the robin shot?

807
01:18:35,915 --> 01:18:39,650
Immobilization, strangulation...
- We've done it three times already.

808
01:18:39,650 --> 01:18:42,826
If you do like training,
you won't get hurt.

809
01:18:42,826 --> 01:18:44,506
We get hurt when training...

810
01:18:44,728 --> 01:18:45,728
Whatever, hurt yourself, then.

811
01:18:49,986 --> 01:18:52,897
We present the glala...
the gladi... the gladiators!

812
01:18:53,752 --> 01:18:59,171
[ all ] Avé Caesar!

813
01:19:13,791 --> 01:19:16,091
GET ME OUT OF HERE!!

814
01:19:16,354 --> 01:19:18,687
OTHERWISE LIONS FOR EVERYONE!

815
01:19:23,824 --> 01:19:26,962
Gorgeous.
- He really has a crazy talent, Petiminus.

816
01:19:27,263 --> 01:19:29,263
He had been nice to us.

817
01:19:29,391 --> 01:19:31,080
Even if it still isn't.

818
01:19:31,080 --> 01:19:34,376
That's it!  The sarcasms begin again!
- I only disguise myself as a Roman...

819
01:19:34,376 --> 01:19:37,258
...only to hire (the enemy).

820
01:19:37,258 --> 01:19:39,391
Exact.
- Hey, we're in Gaul here!

821
01:19:40,319 --> 01:19:41,847
We behave well at the table!

822
01:19:41,847 --> 01:19:43,780
Traitor!  - Who's a traitor?

823
01:19:44,126 --> 01:19:45,126
Invincible we are!

824
01:19:46,596 --> 01:19:48,196
Irreducible we are!

825
01:20:17,198 --> 01:20:20,123
Subtitles made by @Ponali

826
01:20:20,123 --> 01:20:23,071
doing 1 hour and 20 minutes of subtitling
was much harder than i thought and i didnt

827
01:20:23,071 --> 01:20:26,232
think it would take this long. plus, there
are jokes that can only be understood

828
01:20:26,232 --> 01:20:29,378
in France, which makes it harder. and for
the translation part from French to English

829
01:20:29,378 --> 01:20:32,474
there are parts that will not be translated
correctly, thus no way to understand the

830
01:20:32,474 --> 01:20:35,420
jokes and why this movie is funny. i used
software called "Subtitle Edit" which is

831
01:20:35,420 --> 01:20:38,642
what it says. we have some stuff to talk
about like what to download but i am not

832
01:20:38,642 --> 01:20:41,775
going to explain that here. the french
subs took 3 days, but the english one was

833
01:20:41,775 --> 01:20:45,064
much shorter. i was watching out since i
didn't want someone to know i downloaded it

834
01:20:45,064 --> 01:20:48,313
and possibly having copyright issues
regarding this movie.

835
01:20:48,313 --> 01:20:51,340
for more stuff on how i made the subtitles
and such, find me on discord at @ponali

836
01:20:51,340 --> 01:20:54,548
if you're interested, you can see my
YouTube channel: @ponali.mememaker

837
01:20:54,548 --> 01:20:57,714
this is my favorite movie and i
hope you understood everything.

838
01:20:57,714 --> 01:21:00,797
this subtitle is based around the french
one and is auto translated using google

839
01:21:00,797 --> 01:21:03,864
translate. please report any mistranslation
from this subtitle if found one, that would

840
01:21:03,864 --> 01:21:05,544
be really appreciated.
;)
