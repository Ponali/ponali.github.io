# JSArt AppTools Documentation
JSArt AppTools is a (work-in-progress) tool for making 2D apps (like games) inside of JSArt clients ([DayDun Random](https://daydun.com/random/), [Vanilla JSArt](https://ponali.github.io/files/jsart/index.html), [JSArt Modded](https://jsam.codersquack.nl/)...) without having to think about how it actually works behind the scenes, giving more context and understandability to your code.
This document includes a tutorial on how to get started and what functions are currently implemented.

## Getting started
You'll need to add two lines at the start and at the end of your code, they're the ones responsible for loading AppTools.
Copy-paste this line of code:
```
(()=>{if(x+y==0){if(!window.aptf){(()=>{fetch("https://ponali.github.io/files/jsart/modules/appTools.js").then(data=>data.text()).then((body)=>{window.aptf.func=new Function("i","t","x","y","mx","my","sw","sh","c","ic","cl","k","return "+body);window.aptf.func();
```
Press enter a couple of times. If your text editor automatically indents your code, this is normal.
Remove any identation in your line and copy-paste this line of code:
```
})})();window.aptf={"func":(()=>{return 0;})};}}return window.at.result(i,t,x,y,mx,my,sw,sh);})();
```
Now, go back to the lines of code you made between the first and last one. We're going to start initiating variables (initiating â‰  setting.)
For this tutorial, let's say we're making an app with a counter that only counts up when the cursor is in the middle of the screen.
Since we need a variable for the counter, we're going to initiate it. Type `let counter;`.
We're going to define what the app is going to do when starting (initializing). It will have code that sets the counter variable to 0. Type:
```
at.func.init=(()=>{
    counter=0;
    at.initiated=true;
})
```
The reason why the line `at.initiated=true;` exists are for cases where you want to use functions that only outputs inside a callback function, or that takes time (uses a "onload" event). Common callback functions that would be used for initializing would be loading images (`Image.onload`), getting a file from fetch (`fetch("[file]").then(data=>data.text()).then(...)`) or XHR. Using this line tells AppTools that the app has initiated and can now draw content on the screen.
The `at.func.draw` function is where we can put our code on what to draw on the screen.
